  # print("LOAD")

  # 101009 This is called first when the package is loaded into the
  # library as through the library or require commands. Note that a
  # user may have saved a workspace into .RData, and that seems to
  # note the dependency upon the rattle package, and so when R starts
  # up and looks to load the .RData file, it first loads this
  # package. Thus anything here is evaluated first, and then
  # overridden by things from .RData. Thus, the creation of
  # environments, which used to be in here, should be in .onAttach,
  # which is called when the user explicitly loads the package.
  #
  # Thus, when no .RData exists, LOAD and ATTACH happen when there is
  # a library(rattle). When there is an .RData, LOAD happens when R
  # starts up, followed by loading .RData, and ATTACH happens when
  # there is a library(rattle).
  #
  # 080417 The R manual for .onLoad also says to use .onAttach for
  # startup messages, which makes sense as we want to see them when
  # the user loads the package, not when R (possibly on startup)
  # decides to load the package.
}

.onAttach <- function(libname, pkgname)
{
  # print("ATTACH")

  # 101009 This is executed when the package becomes visible to the
  # user, which is usually following a library(rattle). Note that on
  # restoring an .RData file the package might get loaded on starting
  # up R and thus the .onLoad is executed then, but the ATTACH code
  # won't get loaded until we do library(rattle).
  
  # 090315 Create the crs environment here. It is defined here and
  # then also reset in rattle() so that R CMD check would not complain
  # about knowing nothing of crs (after removing the crs <<-
  # assigments throughout rattle)!

#  crs <<- new.env() # 121212 Moved to top of file so not global

  # 090207 Create the global crv environment for Rattle. Once again,
  # this is a deviation from Chamber's Prime Directive, but is akin to
  # the use of option.  It is defined here so that it is globally
  # known and so that plugins can override options. We generally
  # include here the options that can be overridden by a plugin.

  # 100820 GtkBuilder update. Use GtkBuilder as default, except if R
  # version < 2.12.0 on MS/Windows. Here is a collection of tests performed:

  #
  # Notes
  #
  # (1) This FAIL is expected: we get an unhandled 'requires' tag
  #     which is not supported in Gtk 2.12.9.
  #
  # (2) This FAIL is expected: libglade is not loaded.
  #
  # (3) gtk 2.16.6 eis dated 2010-02-24.
  #
  # (4) This FAIL is expected: libglade is not loaded.
  # 
  # The test version of R 2.12.0 was downloaded from

  # https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rtest.html
